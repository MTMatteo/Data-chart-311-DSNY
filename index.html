In the immediate foreground is a pile, almost a wall, of garbage bags stacked 2-3 bags high. The bags have taken up approximately half of the sidewalk. In total, the wall of trash bags stretches almost 15 feet long.  In the near background are two cars, one which the sun is reflecting strongly off of. "</img>

  <p>As the Department of Sanitation is in the news, this time to take the city back from the rats, residents on Staten Island were reminded of the end of 2021. Trash collection ground to a halt, enough so that local media picked up the story. According to NY1, DSNY admitted there was an “abnormal” amount of missed trash collection and would investigate if this was intentional after the mayor mandated all city workers to be vaccinated.
  </p>

    <p>According to numbers provided by City Hall, DSNY’s vaccination rate in mid-October 2021 was 62%. By the Nov. 1 deadline set by de Blasio’s administration, only 83% of DSNY employees were vaccinated. </p>

    <p>311 data seemingly supports the anecdotal beliefs of Staten Islanders. Not only was there an “abnormal” amount of missed collections, October 2021 saw almost as many missed collections as the entire year of 2019.</p>

<p>In response to a request about the investigation of this spike being intentional, Vincent Gragnani of the DSNY Press office said, “As the NY1 piece noted, yes, many residents experienced delays in collection service at the end of October 2021. We moved our uniformed employees to 12-hour shifts and worked the Election Day holiday to make up for the missed collections. By the first week of November, almost all residents of the city were receiving collections on their appointed days.” </p>
