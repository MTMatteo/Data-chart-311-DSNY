# Data-chart-311-DSNY

Using 311 data from the years 2021 and 2019, I looked to see if anecdotal complaints of DSNY's trash pickup being horrible near the end of 2021 were true. What I found was that there was a massive spike in OCtober of 2021, right around when I started hearing complaints from neighbors and locals.
All data used/downloaded from 311 is available here---> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b9t-JYn2NgHEJRQMgCWGbJ4ICFeHj0o8/edit#gid=643697825
